# 📧 Email Lead Extractor (Node.js + Playwright + Express)

A powerful web and file-based email extraction tool built with Node.js, Playwright, Cheerio, and Express. This project allows you to:

- 🕸️ Scrape business contact details (email, phone, address, services) from websites.
- 📂 Upload documents (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, etc.) to extract embedded email addresses.
- ✅ Automatically detect file types and process content using smart parsers (Mammoth, textract, pdf-parse).
- 🌐 Interact via a user-friendly web UI served on `localhost:3000`.
